# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM

###An algorithm that utilizes a kind of recurrent neural network (RNN) called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), where the weights are adjusted for individual data points using stochastic gradient descent and the challenge of this project is to accurately predict the future closing value of a given stock across a given period of time.
